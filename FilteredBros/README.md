# Filtered Bros

[NexusMods Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/broforce/mods/7)  
You can now choose which bro can spawn. Like if you want to spawn with only melee bro, you can.  
If you haven't unlock a bro, their name will be hidden and you won't be able to unchecked their.  
If you uncheck all, it will not work and use the one from the game.
