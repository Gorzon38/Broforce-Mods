# Broforce Overhaul

It's an abandoned project where i wanted to add/change a bunch of thing in the game. Not like [SatanSurprise](../SatanSurprise/) where it was a bunch of non sense changes but a serious one, to make the game better.  
After all I decided to break it into seperate Mods: [TheGeneralsTraining](../TheGeneralsTraining/) (Everything related to bros), [TerroristC4Programs](../TerroristC4Programs/) (Everything related to Terrorists), [VillagerSecretTraining](../VillagerSecretTraining/) (Everything related to villagers/citizens), a mod for Aliens, Hell and Levels.

This is why i discontinued [TweaksFromPigs](../TweaksFromPigs/), I wanted to make a better mod.
