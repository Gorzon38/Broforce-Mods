# Add a Skin

To add a skin, you need to put the `.png` image in the `assets` folder (they can be in subdirectories of `assets`) and with the correct name.  
Every file is stored in `assets` folder .

For the moment only Bros and Enemies can be Reskin.  

## Name the file

For the name of the file, refer to the [Google SpreadSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cJkx3_WMkyk4fcs2_cl5MC_tqbvs9G7UfPje47ywGnw/edit?usp=sharing)

### Character's SpriteSheet

 For the animation of the character, add `_anim0` after the character's name.  
 e.g. 'Rambro_anim0.png' *or* 'rambro_anim0.png'  

 Some characters have more than 1 character's spritesheets, like Double Bro Seven with his balaclava. In this case, you need to increase the '0' after the `_anim`.  
 e.g. 'DoubleBroSeven_anim1.png'  
 *It's the same thing for every SpriteSheets*
