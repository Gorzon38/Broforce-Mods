# Expendabros Bros In Game
 
Allow you to play with the bros of Expendabros in Broforce and Brondfly an "Hidden" Bro.

You can spawn with one of those or rescue them.

* **But you need to rescue them !**  ðŸ’ª
    * 42 rescue for BroneyRoss
    * 52 rescue for LeeBroxmas
    * 62 for BronnarJensen
    * 72 for HaleTheBro
    * 82 for Trent Broser
    * 92 for Broc
    * 102 for TollBroad
    * 861 for Brondfly *(if enable)*

If you have rescue all of the Bros of Broforce you already have them ! :D  
Except Brondfly, maybe..
