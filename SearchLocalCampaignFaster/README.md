# Search Local Campaigns Faster

[NexusMods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/broforce/mods/4)  
In the Custom Campaign Menu, if you go to the OFFLINE tab, the loading takes some times and can be extremly long if you have a lot of levels.  
This mod aim to fix this loading time so it is now a lot more faster.  

If you want details of why it is so lon got load :  
After searching for local levels, Broforce is going to load the WHOLE file. Which means it load the information we see on the menu and the levels which contains: Doodads, Blocks, triggers and some other things. So what the mod does is, instead of loading the whole file, it is going to load only the part we need, which is why the loading is faster.
